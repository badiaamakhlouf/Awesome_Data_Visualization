# Data Visualization

This GitHub repository provides a wide range of instructions, tools, and libraries used by data scientists and analysts to explore various visualization techniques.
These visualizations help in creating interactive plots, extracting insights, and evaluating model results. 
They are primarily used during the exploratory data analysis (EDA) phase to understand the underlying patterns and relationships within the data. 
Additionally, the repository includes tips and tricks for customizing visualizations and offers a brief discussion on the role of data visualization in storytelling and effectively communicating findings to a non-technical audience.
